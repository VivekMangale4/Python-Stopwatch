# Python Stopwatch ⏱️

A simple stopwatch application built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This project allows users to start, pause, reset, and quit the stopwatch interface with an easy-to-use GUI.

## Features

- Start/Resume the stopwatch.
- Pause the stopwatch.
- Reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
- Quit the application.

The stopwatch displays the time in **HH:MM:SS** format and updates every second.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You need to have **Python** installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
- You also need the `tkinter` library, which comes pre-installed with Python. You do not need to install it separately unless you're using a custom Python installation.

### Running the Stopwatch

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python stopwatch.py
```

The application will launch with a graphical interface.

### Code Overview

The application is built using **Tkinter**, a standard GUI library in Python. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Stopwatch Label:** Displays the elapsed time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- **Buttons:**
  - **Start/Resume:** Starts or resumes the stopwatch.
  - **Stop/Pause:** Pauses the stopwatch.
  - **Reset:** Resets the time to 00:00:00.
  - **Quit:** Closes the application.

### Code Snippet

```python
class stopwatch(tk.Frame):
  def __init__(self, window=None):
    super().__init__(window)
    self.window = window
    self.new_time = ""
    self.running = False
    self.total_hours = 0
    self.total_minutes = 0
    self.total_seconds = 0
    self.pack()
    self.features()
```

### Learning Resources

The project was created with the help of YouTube tutorials. It’s a great way to get started with Python GUI programming using **Tkinter**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
